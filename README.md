### simple_security

Ostensibly a simple Auth Service, this project demonstrates a RESTful webservice written for NodeJS, with a PostgreSQL
back-end, featuring a hand-rolled, Object-Oriented, file-based router, and a hand-rolled ORM. 

## Getting Started

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
The "dev" script isn't working quite right. ;)

You can call the webservice controller by sending Postman or cURL requests to localhost:3001.
